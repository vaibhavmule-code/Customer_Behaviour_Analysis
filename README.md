# Customer_Behaviour_Analysis

📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, cleaning, analysis, SQL querying, and dashboard creation. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them through an interactive Power BI dashboard for data-driven decision-making.

📁 Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Python

Contains structured data suitable for analysis and reporting

Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, duplicates, and data type corrections

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python – Data loading, cleaning, and analysis

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – Understanding patterns and trends

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server – SQL queries and data storage

SQL – Data extraction, joins, aggregations, and filtering

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visualization

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported the dataset using Python

Verified schema and data types

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Handled missing and null values

Standardized columns and formats

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified trends, distributions, and outliers
